I worked on setting up Raspberry Pi devices to be used for digital signage. This included installing the required software, setting up the display screens, and making sure the content (like images, videos, or web pages) showed correctly on the screens. I used Python to write scripts that helped control what was shown, when it was shown, and also to manage updates automatically.  Along with that, I also worked on automation tasks using both Python and PHP. This involved writing small programs or scripts that did repeated jobs by themselves, like moving files, sending data between systems, or updating information on websites without needing to do it manually each time. These scripts helped save time and reduce errors in regular tasks.
